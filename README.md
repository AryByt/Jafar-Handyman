# Jefhandyman
This application was made for my father. 
He is a handyman and alwasy wanted a website, so I thought I'd create one for him,
using React and styled it with TailwindCSS. 
This website is still in progress but I'm working on it daily!
I did deploy the website to Netlify here's the deployed link below!
